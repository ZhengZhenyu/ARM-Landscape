# Arm Landscape
Track Arm CI landscape status for open source projects, including areas like big data, database, cloud, cloud native, web, AI, etc.

## How to contribute
The Landscape uses Jekyll and GitHub pages. The projects are described in `./_posts/{area},` and the project logos are located in `./assets/images/{area}/{project}`. A logo should be a clear, 100px * 100px official logo image of the project. The project description should be consistent with the existing projects.
